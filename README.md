## HeMa
### HeMa project，Predict method names based on heuristics. A large amount of excellent method names and parameters and return value types are used as a validation set, and the method names are predicted by parameters and return value types.
## GPTComparisonHeMa
### GPTComparisonHeMa project，According to the HeMa project is experimental logic, through the GPT large model prediction method name, compare the experimental results of the two experiments data.
## code2vec
### code2vec project，Based on deep learning and natural language processing, a large amount of Java files are used as the training set to train the data model, and the method name is predicted according to the model.
